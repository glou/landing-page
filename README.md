# landing-page

This is the first project from The Odin Project updated curriculum (as of September, 28, 2021), related to the new HTML/CSS lessons.
We are asked to do a homepage from a design provided in the corresponding section, along with some "specifications" towards styles.


- 10/3/2021 - Finished the project. Commments along the commits, I'm trying to keep READMEs as simple as possible.
- 10/1/2021 - Decided to build the landing page as a tribute for my girlfriend's birthday.
- 9/28/2021 - Created this repository; started the project.
